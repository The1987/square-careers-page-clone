                <p>We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. So we�re building tools that
                    make commerce easier and more accessible to all. We started with a little white credit card reader but
                    haven�t stopped there. Our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and NFC payments, and our Cash
                    app lets people pay each other back instantly. We�re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices,
                    setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees,
                    and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. Let�s shorten
                    the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. We�re here to help sellers of all sizes
                    start, run, and grow their business�and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.</p>
